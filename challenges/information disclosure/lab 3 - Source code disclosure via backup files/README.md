# WebSecLabs - Source Code Disclosure via Backup Files Lab - Solution

In this readme file, I will explain how I solved the Source Code Disclosure via Backup Files Lab in the WebSecLabs repository. The objective of this lab is to learn how to identify and exploit source code disclosure vulnerabilities caused by backup files left on a web server.

## Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to identify and exploit a source code disclosure vulnerability caused by backup files left on a web server. In this lab, we assume that a web developer has mistakenly left backup files on the server, which could be exploited by an attacker to access the web application's source code.

## Steps

I approached this lab by following the step-by-step instructions provided in the `readme.md` file in the `source code disclosure via backup files` subdirectory of the `Challenges` directory. The following are the steps I took to complete this lab:

1. **Identify the target application:** I started by identifying a vulnerable web application to test for source code disclosure vulnerabilities.
2. **Locate backup files:** Using various tools and techniques, I located backup files on the web server that could be exploited to access the source code.
3. **Exploit the vulnerability:** Once I had identified the backup files, I downloaded them and used them to gain access to the web application's source code.
4. **Document findings:** Finally, I documented my findings and reported them to the web application owner or developer.

## Conclusion

Through this lab, I learned how backup files left on a web server can be exploited to access a web application's source code. I also learned how to use various tools and techniques to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities, including using directory listings, Google dorks, and command-line utilities.

Overall, this lab was an excellent learning experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their web application security skills.
