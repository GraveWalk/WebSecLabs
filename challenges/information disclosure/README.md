# Information Disclosure

Information Disclosure might note seem like a good thing to learn about it might seem like like not a big deal just what kind of data would really mean harm to anyone and if there is data that can harm some one some website why would anyone leave it open trust me you are wrong about it.

##### In this directory i will show you all the labs i have completed on information disclosure at Web Security Academy by PortSwiggers

## Usage

--> `Clone` this directory --> Move to the lab you want to look for

## Structure

This directory is simply structured like a tree there are directories :


- `lab1` --> Information disclosure in error messages
- `lab2` --> Information disclosure on debug page
- `lab3` --> Source code disclosure via backup files

Well you can always move to the direcotry you want solution for but how about you go through each one of them maybe you'll learn something new maybe we solved labs in different ways
