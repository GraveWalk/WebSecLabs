# WebSecLabs - Information Disclosure Lab - Solution

In this readme file, I will explain how I solved the Information Disclosure Lab in the WebSecLabs repository. The objective of this lab is to learn how to identify and exploit information disclosure vulnerabilities on a web application.

## Lab Objective

The lab is designed to help users understand how information disclosure vulnerabilities can be exploited to reveal sensitive information about a web application. In this lab, the objective is to identify and exploit an information disclosure vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data on the web application.

## Steps

I approached this lab by following the step-by-step instructions provided in the `readme.md` file in the `information disclosure` subdirectory of the `Challenges` directory. The following are the steps I took to complete this lab:

1. **Identify the target application:** I started by identifying a vulnerable web application to test for information disclosure vulnerabilities.
2. **Identify sensitive information:** Using various tools and techniques, I identified sensitive information that was being exposed on the target web application.
3. **Exploit the vulnerability:** Once I had identified the sensitive information, I exploited the information disclosure vulnerability to gain access to the data.
4. **Document findings:** Finally, I documented my findings and reported them to the web application owner or developer.

## Conclusion

Through this lab, I learned how information disclosure vulnerabilities can be exploited to reveal sensitive data on a web application. I also learned how to use various tools and techniques to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities, including using browser developer tools, Burp Suite, and command-line utilities.

Overall, this lab was an excellent learning experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their web application security skills.
