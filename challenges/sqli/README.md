# SQL Injection Labs

This directory contains all the labs i have comleted at Web Security Academy by PortSwigger.

## Usage

--> `clone` this directory in your local machine
--> Choose the lab you want to see solution and explanation for

## Structure

There are direcories for every lab marked as:

- `lab1` --> SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
- `lab2` --> SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
- `lab3` --> SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query
- `etc`

You might find your specific in all of these but i would ask you to go through all of them who knows maybe you and i both used different ways to solve the labs
each man has his own mind own thinking process own ways to deal with problems or solve problems.
