## Sub-Directories

### `sqli-lab`

This directory contains all the labs completed for the "SQL injection" module in the Web Security Academy. Each sub-directory within this directory corresponds to a different SQL injection lab.
This directory contains the solutions for the SQL injection labs. Each solution is stored in a seperate `.sql` file and is named according to the corresponding lab it solves.

## Uage

Each sub-directory within the `sqli-lab` directory contains a seperate lab with a corresponding `README.md` file. The `README.md` file provides instructions for completing the lab, along with a breif overview of the attack strategy used to exploit the application.

To view the solution for a particular lab, navigate to the corresponding sub-directory within the `sqli-solution` directory. Each solution is stored in a seperate `.sql` file and can be executed using a SQL client.
