# Lab 2: SQL Injection Vulnerability Allowing Login Bypass

This lab demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to a protected area of the web application.

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain access to a protected area of the web application.

## Steps Taken

To complete this lab, I followed the following steps:

1. Analyzed the web application to identify the vulnerable parameter.

2. Used a web proxy tool to intercept the request and modified the parameter with a single quote (') to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
