# Lab 2: SQL Injection Vulnerability Allowing Login Bypass

This lab demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to a protected area of the web application.

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain access to a protected area of the web application.

## Steps Taken

To complete this lab, I followed the following steps:

   ![Lab](./screenshots/lab.png)

1. This lab is vulnerable in the login form as described in lab discription
    
    ![Lab](./screenshots/login-funtion.png)
    
2. Use `username: administrator` `password: admin` this will cause a error because of incorrrect password

3. Modify the `username: adminstrator` to `username: administrator' OR 1=1--`

     ![Lab](./screenshots/login-funtion-payload.png)
     
     This will make everything after the username a comment which means whatever password you provide it dosen't matter and webapp will be forced to login      as administrator without password

5. Verified that I was able to access the protected area by checking the server's response.

## Conclusion

Through completing this lab, I gained practical experience in identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities that allow login bypass in web applications. I am confident that the skills I acquired will enable me to contribute to any organization's security efforts.

Thank you for reviewing my completed lab!
