# WebSecLabs - OS Command Injection, Simple Case Lab - Solution

In this readme file, I will explain how I solved the OS Command Injection, Simple Case Lab in the WebSecLabs repository. The objective of this lab is to learn how to identify and exploit OS command injection vulnerabilities in a web application.

## Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to identify and exploit an OS command injection vulnerability in a web application. In this lab, we assume that a web developer has mistakenly allowed user input to be passed to the underlying operating system, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands.

## Steps

I approached this lab by following the step-by-step instructions provided in the `readme.md` file in the `os command injection, simple case` subdirectory of the `Challenges` directory. The following are the steps I took to complete this lab:

1. **Identify the target application:** I started by identifying a vulnerable web application to test for OS command injection vulnerabilities.
2. **Locate the vulnerable parameter:** Using various tools and techniques, I located the parameter in the web application that was vulnerable to OS command injection.
3. **Exploit the vulnerability:** Once I had identified the vulnerable parameter, I injected OS commands into it to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
4. **Document findings:** Finally, I documented my findings and reported them to the web application owner or developer.

## Conclusion

Through this lab, I learned how OS command injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by allowing user input to be passed to the underlying operating system. I also learned how to use various tools and techniques to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities, including using Burp Suite, command-line utilities, and payload lists.

Overall, this lab was an excellent learning experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their web application security skills.
