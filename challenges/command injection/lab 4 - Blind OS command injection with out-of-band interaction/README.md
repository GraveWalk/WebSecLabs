# WebSecLabs - Blind OS Command Injection with Out-of-Band Interaction Lab - Solution

In this readme file, I will explain how I solved the Blind OS Command Injection with Out-of-Band Interaction Lab in the WebSecLabs repository. The objective of this lab is to learn how to identify and exploit blind OS command injection vulnerabilities in a web application using out-of-band interaction.

## Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to identify and exploit a blind OS command injection vulnerability in a web application using out-of-band interaction. In this lab, we assume that a web developer has mistakenly allowed user input to be passed to the underlying operating system, but no output is returned to the attacker, making it a blind vulnerability.

## Steps

I approached this lab by following the step-by-step instructions provided in the `readme.md` file in the `blind os command injection with out-of-band interaction` subdirectory of the `Challenges` directory. The following are the steps I took to complete this lab:

1. **Identify the target application:** I started by identifying a vulnerable web application to test for blind OS command injection vulnerabilities with out-of-band interaction.
2. **Locate the vulnerable parameter:** Using various tools and techniques, I located the parameter in the web application that was vulnerable to blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction.
3. **Exploit the vulnerability:** Once I had identified the vulnerable parameter, I injected OS commands into it, which were then used to trigger an out-of-band interaction with a remote server controlled by the attacker. The out-of-band interaction could be used to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
4. **Document findings:** Finally, I documented my findings and reported them to the web application owner or developer.

## Conclusion

Through this lab, I learned how blind OS command injection vulnerabilities with out-of-band interaction can be exploited by allowing user input to be passed to the underlying operating system, but no output is returned to the attacker, making it a blind vulnerability. I also learned how to use various tools and techniques to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities, including using Burp Suite, command-line utilities, and out-of-band interaction channels.

Overall, this lab was an excellent learning experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their web application security skills.
